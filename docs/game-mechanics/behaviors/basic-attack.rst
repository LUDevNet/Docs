BitStream Serialization
-----------------------

align to byte boundary (donâ€™t ask me why, this (and the "padding" below) is completely pointless)

| **[u16]** - This is just :samp:`padding`.
| **[bit]** - True if the attack was :samp:`blocked`.  False otherwise.
| **[bit]** - True if the the target is :samp:`immune`.  False otherwise.
| **[bit]** - True if the attack was successful.  False otherwise.  
| **[u32]** - This is just :samp:`padding`.
| **[u32]** - Amount of damage that was dealt.
| **[bit]** - Whether the target has died?  This value is read in but is never used.
| **[u8]**  - The success state of the attack.
