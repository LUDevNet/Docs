BitStream Serialization
-----------------------

align to byte boundary (donâ€™t ask me why, this (and the "padding" below) is completely pointless)

| **[bit]** - True if the attack was :samp:`blocked`.  False otherwise.
| **[bit]** - True if the the target is :samp:`immune`.  False otherwise.
| **[bit]** - True if the attack was successful.  False otherwise.  
| **[u32]** - This is just :samp:`padding`.
| **[u32]** - Amount of damage that was dealt.
